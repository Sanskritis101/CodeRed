description: To build such an application. there is need to create a central database where all rescue agencies can register their information, including their location, contact details, and areas of expertise. This information could be entered manually by agency administrators, or automated using GPS or other location tracking technologies. Once the database is populated, the application would need to be designed to display this information in an easy-to-use interface It could include a map that shows the locations of all registered rescue agencies, along with filters that allow users to narrow down the results based on specific criteria, such as the type of disaster, the resources available, or the time since the last reported activity. In addition to displaying the locations of rescue agencies, the application could also include features for communication and collaboration. For example, agencies could send alerts or requests for assistance to each other directly through the application, or collaborate on shared resources such as medical equipment or transportation. Security and privacy would be major considerations in building such an application. It would be important to ensure that only authorized users have access to the database, and that sensitive information such as personal contact details is protected. Overall, building an application that allows rescue agencies to coordinate their efforts and provide aid more effectively could be a valuable tool for responding to natural or man-made disasters.

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
